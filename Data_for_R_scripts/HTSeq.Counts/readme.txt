The read count files in each folder are from the same source - the files in the "Raw.HTSeq.counts" folder.
Each folder has files obtained by "subsetting" the raw count files, such that they contain files with common geneIDs
(i.e., geneIDs that have coverage in each of the replicates being considered.)
